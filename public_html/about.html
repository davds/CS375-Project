      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a simple automated cell simulation with only two rules:</p>
      <ol class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">If a non-living cell has 2-3 living cell neighbors, it will be alive in the next “generation”.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If a living cell has exactly 3 neighbors, it will stay alive in the next “generation”. If it has less than 3, it dies of “underpopulation”. If it has more, it dies of “overpopulation”.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Conway’s Game of Death is a cell-automated battle royale based on Conway’s Game of
        Life. The game uses the same life/death logic as CGOL, but with a competitive twist that
        allows players to fight for cells.

          <li class="list-group-item">While waiting for 4 players to connect to a game, players are free to place up to 3 gliders. Right click to rotate a glider, left click to place it. When you have 3 gliders placed, placing another will remove your oldest placed glider. <br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/1ac63b71d1304fc64e4ac30e1d0af90d.gif" width="400"/></li>
          <li class="list-group-item">During the placing phase, players can view the “obstacles” on the board. These are a collection of still lifes and oscillators that either stay still or infinitely loop through a repeating pattern within a bounding box.<br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/b086b186cf7f760d704b5025edea17fb.png" width="400"/></li>

            <li class="list-group-item">Collisions with other players will initiate a strength check; the player with the most living cells on the board at the time of the collision will “conquer” a contested cell.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Players will always win collisions with obstacles. However, cells with 3 or more neighbors die of “overpopulation” so colliding with an obstacle will not always result in a player’s benefit.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Every 5 generations, a red zone closes in from every side of the board. Cells cannot survive inside of the red zone.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Throughout the course of the game, the player names on the right will be sorted based on how many living cells they own on the board.<br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/bb58542b03e72567b59c8070cbb5484a.gif" width="400"/></li>
